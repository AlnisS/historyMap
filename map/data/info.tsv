1000	800	Baghdad as a capital	Baghdad was the capital of the Islamic world until February 10th, 1258 CE. At that point, it was sacked by Mongols. There were also interruptions during the years 808-819 and 836-892. These were because the capital was then relocated to Samarra. Baghdad fell under British mandate in 1920. It became the capital of the kingdom of Iraq in 1932, and Iraq was converted into a republic in 1958. More more information on its history, check out the information about it being sacked.	962	96
1500	1200	Baghdad being sacked	Baghdad was repeatedly sacked. It was the largest city worldwide at the start of the 10th century, but it started to decline later that century. It was eventually sacked in Mongol invasions in 1258, but was rebuilt under Ilkhanid rule. However, it didn’t rise to the same glory it had earlier. It was sacked by Timur in 1401 and went under Turkic rule. It was taken by Safavid Persia in 1508 and fell to the Ottoman empire in 1534. The dissolving of the Ottoman empire caused Baghdad to fall under British mandate in 1920.	961	1
600	500	Construction of Baghdad	Baghdad was built by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mansur. Its construction followed from 762-767 following the Abbasid victory over the Umayyad Caliphate. It replaced Sassanid, capital of Selucia-Ctesiphon (35 km SE) as the regional metropolitan center.	857	327
600	1500	Baghdad design in numbers	Baghdad was circular with a diameter of about 2 km. The circular design was a tribute to Euclid. It was constructed in 762-767 with a new design concept (being circular), a wall 30 m tall and 44 m thick at the base, a deep moat, and battlements.	779	140
1100	300	Design of Baghdad	The circular design was a new concept for cities at the time. Nowadays, current Baghdad is very close to where old Baghdad was. The Golden Gate Palace (the caliph’s home) and the Great Mosque were at the center of the circle. Four gates lined the perimeter with two streets running through them at right angles. They pointed towards other cities: Basra, Kufa, Khurasan, and Damascus.	741	482

800	600	Living in Baghdad	There was a secondary inner wall in Baghdad which protected the caliph’s children, royal servants’ homes, barracks for the horse guard, and other state business buildings. Outside of the inner wall and within the outer wall were other living quarters and commercial buildings.	1165	283
400	1200	Baghdad’s location	Baghdad’s location was chosen so that it would be at a central point between trade routes. This allowed it to act as a regional hub for trade. This in turn supplied it with consistent revenue. Deserts around it made it stand out.	1020	588
1500	600	Function of Baghdad	Baghdad was a major hub for the silk roads. It was a sort of a forwarding and distribution area for goods brought to it. Both locals brought goods to be traded to faraway lands and faraway goods came in to be distributed. This provided Baghdad with a stable source of income.	1124	33

675	450	Heian-Kyo as a capital	Heian-Kyo was the capital of Japan from 794 to 1868 with a brief interruption in 1180. It still sort of is the capital of Japan since Tokyo has not officially become the capital of Japan. It was the main center of politics until 1185, when the samurai Minamoto clan defeated the Taira clan in the Genpei War. They then moved national affairs to Kamakura and established the Kamakura shogunate. However, Heian-Kyo remained the site of the Imperial Court, the seat of Imperial power, and remained the official on-paper capital. The seat of Imperial power moved to Tokyo in 1868, but no law was passed stating that Tokyo is the capital, so legally/officially Heian-Kyo is still sort of the capital of Japan.	308	266
675	200	Sacking of Heian-Kyo	Almost half of Heian-Kyo burned down in the Onin war and the split between upper kamigyo and lower kamigyo occurred. However, it was never really leveled.	566	473

300	500	Heian-Kyo design in numbers	Heian-Kyo was square by the principles of geomancy. A system of measures was used to standardize street widths. These included the Jo, a basic measurement unit equalling about 3.03 m, and the Cho, which was a unit of area composed of 40 Jo length sides. The city boundaries made a rectangle of 4.5 km width and 5.2 km height oriented with the long side facing north-south.	107	573
200	1200	Design of Heian-Kyo	Heian-Kyo was modeled after Tang Chang'an (Xi’an), but without walls and in the layout of Heijo-Kyo. The palace was built first at the center of the far north end of the city limits. The city was then built around the palace. The palace was visible from other parts of the city. Suzaku avenue went down the center. It split the city into the left (sakyo, east) and right (ukyo, west) parts of the city. It is in what now is central Kyoto.	367	26

They started to farm there, which was originally forbidden within city limits, but the laws changed as the city spread east.	202	156
800	1600	Place of Heian-Kyo	The location of Heian-Kyo was chosen because of the beautiful mountains and rivers there. It was also a convenient place for assembly as it had good links to sea and land transportation. Higashiyama (eastern mountains), Kitayama (northern mountains), and Nishiyama (western mountains) made the city look like a natural castle.	14	480
1000	300	Functions of Heian-Kyo	Two ports, Yodonotsu, and Oitsu were built and helped to provide the capital with food and supplies. They acted as a forwarding system for bringing supplies from far away to the capital. The capital itself was the location of Japan’s government.	566	156
200	1600	Fun facts about Heian-Kyo	Takamikura (the special emperor throne) remains there even though emperor not there. The emperor’s residence there still preserved, even though the emperor hasn’t returned from Tokyo. It also serves as a backup capital.	399	586
